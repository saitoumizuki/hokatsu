# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# require "csv"

# CSV.foreach('db/sample.csv') do |row|
#   Nursery.create(admin_id: row[0], name: row[1], category: row[2], nearest: row[3], phone: row[4], phone_middle: row[5], phone_right: row[6], email: row[7], capacity: row[8],
#   					date: row[9], time: row[10], holiday: row[11], url: row[12], post_code: row[13], address: row[14], latitude: row[15], longitude: row[16],
#   					created_at: row[17], updated_at: row[18]
